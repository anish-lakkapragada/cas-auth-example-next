# Yale SWE (CPSC 439/539) CAS Auth Example App

## Overview 

[CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Authentication_Service) stands for Central Authentication System, a single sign-on (SSO) protocol developed at Yale University. This is an example Next.js app for Yale's Software Engineering (CPSC 439/539) class that demonstrates how to use Yale CAS for simple authentication. 

This application is meant as a modern Next.js re-write from this [well-written Yale CAS example](https://github.com/yale-swe/cas-auth-example-express).
